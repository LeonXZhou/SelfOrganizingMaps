Kohonen:
Design:
Weights are initialized randomly. 1000 epochs are run to converge the centroids, 
unless other termination criteria are met.Each epoch loops through all data points. 
Weights are adjusted using the Kohonen Algorithm and an initial learning rate of 0.5. 
The learning rate is decreased with each epoch to improve rate of convergence and reduce
oscilations in centroid positions. If the absolute magnitude of the change of the centroid 
positions is below 0.1 the centroids are assumed to have converged and the trainingng stops.

KMEAN:

Design:
Weights are initialized randomly.1000 epochs are run to converge the centroids, 
unless other termination criteria are met.ach epoch loops through all data points.
After each data point is sorted into a cluster a new centroid is calculated using
the mean of all points in that cluster. If absolute magnitude of the centroids are changing
less than 0.0001 the centroids are assumed to have converged and training is stopped. In addition
if the mean squared error is below 1 the centroids are assumed to be in their optimal position and 
training is stopped.
